This project is a GUI-based Tic Tac Toe game built using Python (Tkinter). It allows two players to take turns marking a 3x3 grid, with the game detecting:

Winning conditions – Three marks in a row, column, or diagonal

Draw detection – If all cells are filled with no winner

Interactive UI – User-friendly interface with real-time updates

This project demonstrates Python GUI development and game logic implementation.
