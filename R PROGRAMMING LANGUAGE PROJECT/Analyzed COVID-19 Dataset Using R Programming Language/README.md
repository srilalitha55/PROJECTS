COVID-19 Dataset Analysis Using R Programming Language

This project analyzes a COVID-19 dataset using R programming, focusing on data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

Objectives

Understand the impact of COVID-19 through data-driven insights.

Identify trends in cases, recoveries, and fatalities.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using R.

Visualize data using ggplot2 and other R libraries.

Key Steps

1. Data Import & Cleaning

Imported the dataset into RStudio using read.csv().

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

Filtered and structured data for better analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed case trends over time using dplyr and tidyverse.

Grouped data by country/region to observe the spread.

Calculated key metrics: total cases, active cases, recoveries, and deaths.

3. Statistical Analysis

Identified case fatality rate (CFR) and recovery rate.

Compared infection rates across different countries.

Evaluated correlations between testing rates and reported cases.

4. Data Visualization

Created line charts for case progression over time.

Used bar plots to compare cases between countries.

Designed heatmaps for geographical representation.

Tools & Libraries Used

RStudio – Development environment

tidyverse – Data manipulation and cleaning

ggplot2 – Data visualization

dplyr – Data wrangling

Insights & Conclusions

Identified peak infection periods for different regions.

Observed the impact of lockdown measures on case trends.

Highlighted variations in recovery and fatality rates across countries.

This project demonstrates data handling, statistical analysis, and visualization using R, making it valuable for pandemic research and decision-making.
